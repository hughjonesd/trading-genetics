People in the marriage market have two characteristics: $x=\left( x_{1},x_{2}\right)$, drawn from a normal distribution 
\[
\mathcal{N}
\left( 
\begin{array}{c}
0 \\ 
0%
\end{array}%
,%
\begin{array}{cc}
s^{2} & \sigma \\ 
\sigma & S^{2}%
\end{array}%
\right).
\]
We interpret $x_1$ as a genetic measure, and $x_2$ as a measure of SES or of social status more generally. The 
correlation between $x_1$ and $x_2$ is then

\[
Corr=\frac{\sigma }{sS}.
\]

People's attractiveness is given by
\[
i\left( x\right) =ax_{1}+\left( 1-a\right) x_{2}
\]
where $a \in [0, 1]$ is a parameter reflecting the relative importance of genetics to SES 
in the marriage market.[^a-interpretation] If $a = 0$, marriage markets are highly
inegalitarian, such that only SES matters. If $a = 1$, marriage markets are egalitarian
and only genetics matter. We expect realistic societies to fall between these extremes.
Attractiveness $i$ is distributed $N(0,\sigma_{I}^{2})$, where
\[
\sigma _{I}^{2}=a^{2}s^{2}+\left( 1-a\right) ^{2}S^{2}+2a\left( 1-a\right)\sigma.
\]

[^a-interpretation]: Note that since the variance of the shocks to $x_1$ and $x_2$
(see below) has been normalized to 1, $a$ also reflects this variance. That
is, a large variance of SES shocks (compared to genetic shocks) translates into 
$a$ being large. 

People form matches with transferable utility, where the surplus for a match
between $x$ and $y$ is $S(i(x), i(y))$ such that 
$\partial^{2}S/\partial i\partial j > 0$, i.e. $S$ is supermodular. As a result there
is positive assortative mating on attractiveness: $x$ matches with $y$
only if $i(x_{1},x_{2}) = i(y_{1},y_{2})$. We describe this as
social-genetic assortative mating (SGAM).

We also consider random matching (RM) as a benchmark to compare against SGAM.
Under RM, the distribution of couples' characteristics is normal with mean 0 and
covariance matrix
\[
\mathbb{C}\left( 
\begin{array}{c}
x_{1} \\ 
x_{2} \\ 
y_{1} \\ 
y_{2}%
\end{array}%
\right) =\allowbreak \left( 
\begin{array}{cccc}
s^{2} & \sigma & 0 & 0 \\ 
\sigma & S^{2} & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & s^{2} & \sigma \\ 
0 & 0 & \sigma & S^{2}%
\end{array}%
\right). \allowbreak 
\]

## Couples under SGAM

\begin{proposition}\label{prop-couples-SGAM}
Under SGAM, the distribution of couples' characteristics is normal, with mean 0
and covariance matrix
\[
\mathbb{C}\left( 
\begin{array}{c}
x_{1} \\ 
x_{2} \\ 
y_{1} \\ 
y_{2}%
\end{array}%
\right) =\allowbreak \left( 
\begin{array}{cccc}
s^{2} & \sigma  & A^{2} & AC \\ 
\sigma  & S^{2} & AC & C^{2} \\ 
A^{2} & AC & s^{2} & \sigma  \\ 
AC & C^{2} & \sigma  & S^{2}%
\end{array}%
\right) \allowbreak 
\]
where:
\begin{align*}
A &= \frac{as^{2}+\left( 1-a\right) \sigma }{\sqrt{a^{2}s^{2}+\left(
1-a\right) ^{2}S^{2}+2a\left( 1-a\right) \sigma }} &= \frac{as^{2}+\left( 1-a\right) \sigma }{\sigma_I}; \\
C &= \frac{a\sigma +\left( 1-a\right) S^{2}}{\sqrt{a^{2}s^{2}+\left(
1-a\right) ^{2}S^{2}+2a\left( 1-a\right) \sigma }} &= \frac{a\sigma +\left( 1-a\right) S^{2}}{\sigma_I}.
\end{align*}

In particular, the covariance between $x_2$ and $y_1$, $AC$, is positive if either
$\sigma > 0$ or $\sigma = 0$ and $0 < a < 1$.

\begin{proof}
See Appendix.
\end{proof}
\end{proposition}

We consider the distribution of couples' SES. Under RM this has 
mean $0$ and variance $2S^2$. Under SGAM, the variance is:
\[
V\left( x_{2}+y_{2}\right) =2S^{2}+2C^{2}>2S^{2} 
\]
Note, however, that 
\[
V\left( x_{2}+y_{2}\right) \leq 4S^{2} 
\]
which would be reached if $a=0$, i.e. if people only matched on SES. Thus,
SGAM increases cross-sectional inequality but less so than pure matching on SES. 

XXX is the above true only if $\sigma=0$?

## Children

All couples have the same number of children. Assume that a child's characteristics are given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
x_{1}^{\prime } &=&\frac{\tau }{2}\left( x_{1}+y_{1}\right) +\varepsilon
\label{Chil} \\
x_{2}^{\prime } &=&\frac{\theta }{2}\left( x_{2}+y_{2}\right) +\eta 
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $x$ and $y$ are the child's parents, and $\varepsilon$ and $\eta$ are
normal random shocks with mean $0$ and variance $1$.

Parameter $\tau \approx 1$ reflects genetic inheritance. Under standard biological
assumptions $\tau=1$ and characteristics show no regression to the mean. In our
model this leads the variance of $x_1$ to grow without limit over generations.
In reality, we expect $\tau < 1$ because very extreme characteristics are
selected against, a process known as stabilizing selection.

Parameter $\theta \in [0, 1]$ reflects inheritance of SES. Unlike $\tau$ it may vary
between societies. $\theta$ is high when there is high intergenerational
transmission of SES. If we interpret $x_2$ narrowly as wealth, $(1 - \theta)$
can be thought of as the rate of inheritance taxation.

For the time being, we assume that a person's genetic endowment has no impact on
their SES. Technically, thus, $x_{2}^\prime$ does not directly depend on
$x_{1}^\prime$. In a meritocratic society we would expect this to be violated.
We show that even absent meritocracy, correlations between $x_1^\prime$ and
$x_{2}^\prime$ can arise.

We can now calculate the covariance matrix for 
$x^\prime = (x_{1}^{\prime }, x_{2}^{\prime })$ under SGAM as: 

\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{C} &=&\left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0 \\ 
0 & 1%
\end{array}%
\right) +\left( 
\begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{\tau }{2} & 0 & \frac{\tau }{2} & 0 \\ 
0 & \frac{\theta }{2} & 0 & \frac{\theta }{2}%
\end{array}%
\right) \allowbreak \left( 
\begin{array}{cccc}
s^{2} & \sigma  & A^{2} & AC \\ 
\sigma  & S^{2} & AC & C^{2} \\ 
A^{2} & AC & s^{2} & \sigma  \\ 
AC & C^{2} & \sigma  & S^{2}%
\end{array}%
\right) \allowbreak \left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{1}{2}\tau  & 0 \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{2}\theta  \\ 
\frac{1}{2}\tau  & 0 \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{2}\theta 
\end{array}%
\right) \nonumber \\
&=&\left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{1}{2}A^{2}\tau ^{2}+\frac{1}{2}s^{2}\tau ^{2}+1 & \frac{1}{2}\theta
\sigma \tau +\frac{1}{2}AC\theta \tau  \\ 
\frac{1}{2}\theta \sigma \tau +\frac{1}{2}AC\theta \tau  & \frac{1}{2}%
C^{2}\theta ^{2}+\frac{1}{2}S^{2}\theta ^{2}+1%
\end{array}%
\right) \allowbreak \label{cov-children-SGAM}
\end{eqnarray}
\newline

We now explore two issues. First, under SGAM, genetic characteristics are no
longer exogenous; because of assortative matching, they are (partly) socially
determined. In particular, even if genetics and SES are uncorrelated among
parents, the expected genetic endowment of the child is positively related to
parental SES. Second, as a result, in the long run a correlation appears between
traits; that is, high SES people have genes which are attractive in marriage
markets.

Regarding point 1, we compute the expected genetic characteristic of the
child, conditional on parental SES:
\[
\mathbb{E}\left[ \frac{\tau }{2}\left( x_{1}+y_{1}\right) +\varepsilon \mid
x_{2}=v,y_{2}=w\right] 
\]
Given the symmetry of the model, this conditional
expectation only depends on the parents' total wealth, i.e. $v+w$.

\begin{claim}\label{claim-E-children-RM}
Under random matching, the expected genetic endowment of the children is
proportional to the parents' SES and to the covariance between SES and genetics
for the parents. In particular, if $\sigma = 0$ (i.e. genetics and SES are
uncorrelated for the parents), then the expected genetic endowment of the
children does not depend on parental SES.
\end{claim}



\begin{claim}\label{claim-E-children-SGAM}
Under SGAM, if $\sigma = 0$ (i.e. genetics and
SES are uncorrelated for the parents), then the expected genetic endowment of
the children is linearly increasing in parental SES. The relationship
increases with the ratio of genetic variance to wealth variance, is zero for $a = 0$ or $a = 1$, 
and is highest for intermediate values of $a$.
\end{claim}


Next, we study the correlation between children's traits 1 and 2 as a function
of $\sigma$, the covariance of parents' traits. We first consider the
general case, then concentrate on $\sigma = 0$, i.e. when traits are initially
uncorrelated.

\begin{claim}\label{claim-corr-children-RM}
Under random matching, the correlation between characteristics is smaller
for children than for parents. In particular, if genetics and wealth are
uncorrelated for the parents, then they are uncorrelated for the children.
\end{claim}

\begin{claim}\label{claim-corr-children-SGAM}
Under SGAM, if genetics and wealth are uncorrelated for the parents, then they
are positively correlated for the children so long as $0 < a < 1$. The 
correlation is increasing in $\theta$.
\end{claim}

Whether characteristics are more or less correlated for children than for
parents depends on whether the initial correlation between parents'
characteristics is larger or smaller than the asymptotic one, derived later
on.

These results show that SGAM can lead to a genes-SES gradient, i.e. a positive
correlation between genes and SES. Also, the strength of the genes-SES
correlation is affected by economic institutions, as captured in $\theta$.
When $\theta$ is high, the genes-SES correlation is high too. As we would expect,
these results carry over to the asymptotic distribution.


## Asymptotics


\begin{proposition}\label{prop-asymptotics-RM}
Under RM, the dynamics converges to a stationary distribution that is normal
with mean zero and covariance matrix 
\[
C=\left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{2}{2-\tau ^{2}} & 0 \\ 
0 & \frac{2}{2-\theta ^{2}}%
\end{array}%
\right) \allowbreak 
\]%
In particular, the traits are asymptotically uncorrelated and children's expected genetic
endowment is independent of parents' SES.

\end{proposition}


\begin{proposition}\label{prop-asymptotics-SGAM}
Under SGAM, for $\theta <1$ and $\tau <1$, the dynamics converge to a stationary
distribution that is normal with mean zero and covariance matrix 
\[
C=\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\bar{s}^{2} & \bar{\sigma} \\ 
\bar{\sigma} & \bar{S}^{2}%
\end{array}%
\right) 
\]

For $\theta =1$, the dynamics diverge and $S^{2}$ goes to $+\infty $; for $%
\tau =1$, the dynamics diverges and $s^{2}$ goes to $+\infty $.

XXX what can we say about $\bar{\sigma}$ e.g. if $0 < a < 1$. Is it positive? Increasing in
$\theta$? Increasing then decreasing in $a$?
\end{proposition}


Conditional expectations of children's genetics given parents' SES under SGAM
are calculated using the same formula as before, plugging in moments of the 
asymptotic distribution:

\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{E}\left[ \frac{\tau }{2}\left( x_{1}+y_{1}\right) +\varepsilon \mid
x_{2}=v,y_{2}=w\right]  &=&\frac{1}{2}\tau \frac{\bar{\sigma}+\bar{A}\bar{C}%
}{\bar{C}^{2}+\bar{S}^{2}}\left( v+w\right)  \\
&=&\mu \frac{\theta \bar{S}^{2}}{2\bar{S}^{2}-2}
\end{eqnarray}

### Numerical application

In what follows, we impose
\[
\tau = 0.95.
\]
The three components of the asymptotic covariance matrix 
($s^{2},S^{2},\sigma$) are given in the following graph:

(XXX omitted)

Lastly, the asymptotic correlation between characteristics is:
\[
Corr=\frac{\sigma }{sS}=\frac{\mu }{\sqrt{\lambda }}=\frac{\phi \left(
a,\theta ,\tau \right) }{\sqrt{\psi \left( a,\theta ,\tau \right) }}
\]

(XXX graph omitted)

and the conditional expectation
of genetics given wealth is proportional to wealth, coefficient:

(XXX graph omitted)

Note that both $\bar{S}^{2}$ and $\bar{\sigma}$, as well as the correlation
between characteristics and the conditional expectation of genetics given
wealth, are increasing in $\theta$, i.e. decreasing in the tax rate. Higher
taxation reduces the asymptotic variance of wealth (not surprisingly), but
also the correlation between genetic and wealth. 

## Extensions

We consider robustness in two dimensions. First, the weight of $x_1$ and
$x_2$ might differ for men and women, for example if SES is more important for
men's attractiveness. Suppose that men's and women's attractiveness are given by
\begin{align*}
i(x) = ax_1 + (1-a)x_2; \\
j(y) = by_1 + (1-b)y_2
\end{align*}
respectively. Then Claims \ref{claim-E-children-SGAM} and 
\ref{claim-corr-children-SGAM} continue to hold.

XXX put proof in appendix

Second, we consider non-normal distributions of $x_1$ and $x_2$, and
non-linear attractiveness functions. Suppose
\begin{equation}
i(x) = f(ax_1, (1-a)x_2) \label{non-linear-f}
\end{equation}
with $f$ strictly increasing in both its arguments. Our sole condition on $x$ is 
that a positive measure of the population has attractiveness $i(x) = i$ where 
the distribution of $(x_1, x_2)|i$ is non-degenerate, i.e. not
everybody with attractiveness $i$ is both genetically and socially identical. 

\begin{proposition}\label{prop-non-normal}
Let attractiveness be given by \eqref{non-linear-f}. If the correlation 
between $x_1$ and $x_2$ is 0, then the 
correlation among children between $x^\prime_1$ and $x^\prime_2$ is non-negative,
and strictly positive if $0 < a < 1$.
\end{proposition}


## Discussion

The "marriage market" here is a reduced form mechanism, encompassing
everything that makes a difference to partner choice. For example, if
earned income affects attractiveness in the marriage market, then
society's level of meritocracy in the labour market will correlate with
the value of $a$: a more meritocratic labour market will allow people
with low social status but high human capital (genetically determined in
part) to earn more, and therefore to match with more attractive
partners.

The meanings of both social status, and "good genes" in the
marriage market, are likely to vary across societies. Social status could
encompass variables like social class or caste; ethnic identity in
"ranked" ethnic systems; or in modern societies, SES. Regarding genetics,
standards of physical attractiveness, and other characteristics which
make someone a "good match", vary across societies and over time.

Recent empirical work shows high persistence of SES over time, in particular at
the top. XXX insert stuff about grandchild-control here.

The converse also holds: regressions of children's characteristics on their
genetics alone risk overestimating the effect of genetics, by confounding it
with the effects of correlated socio-economic status. Recent work in genetics
has shown just this. Polygenic scores for educational attainment have smaller
effects in between-sibling regressions, where between-family variation in SES is
partialled out and where genes are guaranteed to be randomly allocated, than in
regressions which pool the whole sample [@howe2021within]. Parents' genetic
variants which are *not* passed on to children predict children's
characteristics, via environmental effects [@kong2018nature].

The model predicts variation in the strength of SGAM. In particular, in
"caste societies" where there is complete endogamy within social status
groups, there is no scope for SGAM, because marriage partners do not
trade off genetics for social status. Also, SGAM is increased by $\theta$. This
implies that policy has long-run effects on the social structure: reducing
$\theta$ not only increases intergenerational mobility, but reduces
the correlation of genes with SES, and hence the unfairness of what has been
called the "genetic lottery" [@harden2021genetic].

In modern societies, both SGAM and meritocratic mobility are likely to
be at play. Genetic variants that cause (e.g.) higher income and wealth
will be inherited along with components of social status such as
inherited wealth. At the same time, higher social status and "good
genes" will assort in the marriage market, even if that higher social
status is caused by purely environmental variation. Our empirical
analysis shows this latter process at work. (XXX needs model it with gamma)
